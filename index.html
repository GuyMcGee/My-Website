                  "I've had the pleasure of working with Adam as a third-party
                  mentor. Over this time, I've had the chance to see Adam's
                  hard-work, resiliency and learning capacity first hand. Software
                  development is not an easy thing to learn, especially when
                  starting from a place of little context, but Adam has taken that
                  challenge head on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adam has exceptional work ethic and attention to detail. Not
                  settling for satisfactory, he spends extra time making sure his
                  work goes above and beyond what is required. He demonstrated
                  this by consistently asking me if I would be willing to coach
                  him through extra credit portions of his coding assignments,
                  expressing a desire to be able to understand how to solve all
                  the problems presented. This mentality certainly paid dividends
                  as Adam progressed from writing simple mathematics expressions
                  in a C# console application, to designing and implementing his
                  own full-stack web application in ASP.NET in just six months.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adam has been a joy to mentor and any team he joins will get a
                  friendly, hard-working, and fun-loving person who will do
                  everything he can to add value to and support his teammates."

                <p>"I have been working with Adam in a mentorship capacity for the past several months. He is a genuinely curious person who asks well-articulated questions in an unassertive manner. In our time together, I have observed several instances of his willingness to tackle problems on his own before asking for assistance. In many such cases, he has demonstrated a knack for getting to grips with programming concepts on his own through self-study and application."</p>
                <p>
                  Another trait about Adam that anyone will notice upon meeting him is his tendency to over-deliver. This is sometimes because he is particularly interested in exploring a new concept, or simply because he wants to use the task at hand to further develop competencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am confident that Adam’s humble demeanor, determination to solve problems independently, and tendency to exceed expectations would make him a great fit within any software engineering organization."

                "I am pleased to recommend Adam Lair. I have known Adam for about
                five years, and it has been my privilege to serve with him in
                multiple contexts. When I became the President of Cornerstone
                Bible Institute a few years ago, Adam was the first person I
                invited to join our faculty. I have witnessed and admire his
                strong work ethic, gifted teaching ability, and excellent
                relational skills with both students and coworkers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adam’s giftedness and exceptional leadership qualities have
                captured my heart. He is a man of exceptional moral character and gives evidence of a strong, vibrant Christian faith. As long as I have known him, he has been steadfast in his devotion to the Christian principles of honesty, integrity, and irreproachable moral conduct. I deeply admire his conviction in these areas. He is a loving and committed husband and father who is faithfully raising his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over and above his fine character, though, Adam is simply one of
                a kind. His gentle, humble demeanor makes him a joy to be
                around. He is approachable and admired by all who know him. He
                is intelligent, caring, and an excellent communicator.
              </p>
              <p>
                In more than thirty years of formal business and ministry
                experience, I have met many fine, upstanding, moral men and
                women, and I can think of no one whom I would commend more
                highly than Adam Lair.
              </p>
              <p>
